Therefore the answer is 2


-------->  Solution   ----


def count_favourite_singers(n, songs):
    singer_counts = {}
    max_count = 0
    
    # Count the occurrences of each singer in the playlist
    for singer in songs:
        if singer in singer_counts:
            singer_counts[singer] += 1
        else:
            singer_counts[singer] = 1
        
        max_count = max(max_count, singer_counts[singer])
    
    # Count the number of singers with the maximum count
    num_favourite_singers = 0  # Initialize the count to zero

# Loop through each count in the dictionary
    for count in singer_counts.values():
        # Check if the count is equal to the maximum count
        if count == max_count:
            # If yes, increment the count of favourite singers
            num_favourite_singers += 1
        
    return num_favourite_singers

# Input
n = int(input())
songs = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Output
result = count_favourite_singers(n, songs)
print(result)
